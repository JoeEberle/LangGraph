## 🧠 LangGraph — A Framework to Jumpstart Your Agentic Projects

**LangGraph** and **LangChain** is a powerful, open source framework designed to accelerate the development of AI Agents  driven solutions. 

Balance agent control with agency 

Gain control with LangGraph to design agents that **reliably handle complex tasks**.




## 🧠 Steps to Establish a LangGraph Workflow

1. **Define the goal** — Clearly state the single problem or capability the graph is meant to solve.
2. **Design the shared state** — Decide what information must persist and evolve across nodes.
3. **Identify the nodes** — Break the workflow into small, single-purpose steps.
4. **Implement node functions** — Write pure functions that take state in and return updated state.
5. **Determine conditional logic** — Identify where decisions, branching, or retries are required.
6. **Connect the edges** — Wire nodes together using static and conditional transitions.
7. **Set start and end points** — Explicitly define how the graph begins and terminates.
8. **Compile the graph** — Validate and lock the graph structure for execution.
9. **Test with simple inputs** — Run minimal cases to verify state transitions and routing.
10. **Add guardrails and logging** — Apply limits, error handling, and observability for safe execution.
